I'm a professional C++ software developer since 2002.

While I strongly believe in using the right tool for the job, I'm also an avid fan of safe, reliable and efficient programming, so safe C++ and Rust code is where my interests are focused. Most of my software is cross-platform, but I mainly use Linux as my desktop and development platform.

I also have a tech blog at [blog.shaduri.dev](https://blog.shaduri.dev) where I discuss various programming tips and techniques.
